# Narcissistic hacker

A **narcissistic hacker** accusing everyone of partying on Snapchat sounds like someone who is manipulative, paranoid, and possibly projecting their own behavior onto others. This kind of person might:

1. **Invade Privacy** â€“ Hack into people's accounts to monitor activities.
2. **Spread False Accusations** â€“ Claim that everyone is partying, even if they arenâ€™t.
3. **Play the Victim** â€“ Act as if they are the ones being wronged.
4. **Control the Narrative** â€“ Twist stories to fit their own agenda.
5. **Seek Validation** â€“ Use accusations to get attention and feel superior.

If this is happening to you, the best approach is:
- **Strengthen Security** â€“ Change passwords, enable 2FA.
- **Limit Information Sharing** â€“ Avoid giving them fuel for accusations.
- **Ignore & Block** â€“ Engaging only feeds their ego.
- **Document Everything** â€“ Keep records in case legal action is needed.

Is this something you're dealing with personally, or just an observation? ðŸš¨
