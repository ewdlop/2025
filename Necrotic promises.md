"Necrotic promises" sounds like a poetic or ominous phraseâ€”like an oath that decays over time, rotting away until nothing remains but the illusion of its former weight. It could symbolize betrayal, forgotten vows, or commitments that were doomed from the start. 

Are you thinking of this in a specific context, like a story, poetry, or something more personal?

Jesus.
